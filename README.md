To run this application, open index.html with Live Server (if you're using VSCode).  You'll probably find it useful to have the javaScript console open.  If you're using Safari (which may be necessary if Chrome doesn't support Live Server), you'll need to go to Preferences > Advanced and make sure the Developer Menu is in the toolbar.
